Bruce's History
=================================
Bruce Cueno, as a thirteen year old in 1970 worked for his father at Ace muffler
service in Chicago (7157 W. Irving Park Rd.) His dream was to become a master
mechanic and someday, take over the business after his father retired. That summer,
Bruce had the opportunity to watch a sign painter/pinstriper (Will Jarvis) letter and
pinstripe a stock race car. As he quietly watched him all day and after Will left he told
everyone that he could learn how to do that. The very next day, Bruce went to the
drug store, picked up some hobby brushes and tried to make a sign of his own. His
father hung the sign in the shop where it remains to this day. Ever since that day,
Bruce has used his god-given talent and patience to sustain customer satisfaction.
